To run the program, import both projects into eclipse. Run the HW4Server program first, and then while its running, start the HW4 project to launch the calculator application. All equations and answers are stored in the file "Equations.txt" which is located in the HW4Server folder. The client/server connection runs across localhost, and uses port 2121 for the connection.
